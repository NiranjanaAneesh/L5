            <h2>Facts About Tigers</h2>
            <p>Size: Tigers are the largest big cats in the wild. Male tigers can grow up to 3.5 meters long and weigh up to 250
            kilograms, while females can grow up to 3 meters long and weigh up to 170 kilograms.
            Habitat: Tigers live in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, northeastern
            China, and eastern Russia.
            Diet: Tigers eat large prey like wild pigs and deer.
            Stripes: Each tiger has unique stripes.
            Communication: Tigers can communicate using their ears and have a wide range of vocalizations.
            Swimming: Tigers are excellent swimmers and enjoy spending time in water. They often bathe in rivers to cool off.
            Cubs: Tiger cubs are born blind and weigh between 1.75 and 3.5 pounds. Their eyes open after about six to twelve days.
